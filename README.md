## Technical Details

This website is build with [gatsbyjs](https://gatsbyjs.org), and hosted off [netlify](https://netlify.com). It is recommened you look at gatsby docs before contributing to this repo :). If there are any features that requires netlify config please get into contact with [Joshua Inglis](jt.inglis@outlook.com)

## Local Development

1. install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Clone this repo
3. Install dependancies | `npm install`
4. run local build with | `npm start`

### On Windows

Building the packages required by gatsby is difficult on Windows.
We recommend developing with docker, for which we have provided a `docker-compose.yml` file.

You can run it with:
```bash
docker-compose up develop
```

Be patient when running it for the first time as it runs an npm install to your current directory,
but for some reason does not display the installation commands as its running - can take up to 5 minutes.
